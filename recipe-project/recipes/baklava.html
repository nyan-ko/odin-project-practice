    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This honey baklava is flaky, crisp and tender and I love that it isn’t overly sweet. It’s basically a party in your mouth. I am a huge fan of baklava and this is the BEST baklava recipe I have ever tried. Hands down.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 oz) package of phyllo (fillo) dough</li>
      <li>butter idk</li>
      <li>honee</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Thaw phyllo dough according to package instructions (this is best done overnight in the fridge, then place it on the counter for 1 hour before starting your recipe to bring it to room temp).</li>
      <li>Trim phyllo dough to fit your baking sheet. My phyllo dough package had 2 rolls with a total of 40 sheets that measured 9×14 so I had to trim them slightly. You can trim one stack at a time then cover with a damp towel to keep from drying out.</li>
      <li>Butter the bottom and sides of a 13×9 non-stick baking pan.</li>
    </ol>
